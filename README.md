# l-game
An end-to-end Python implementation of the L-Game featuring human vs. AI gameplay. The project includes a modular architecture separating the board logic, game engine, player interfaces, and AI decision system. The AI uses search-based strategies and heuristic evaluation to play competitively. Runs entirely in the terminal.
