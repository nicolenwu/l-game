# l-game
An end-to-end Python implementation of the L-Game featuring optional AI gameplay. The AI agent uses search-based strategies and heuristic evaluation to play competitively. The game runs entirely in the terminal.

* This project was developed during my undergraduate studies at UC Merced. Although implemented in a single Python file for ease of execution and submission, the code is logically organized and could be refactored into modular components in a larger-scale setting
